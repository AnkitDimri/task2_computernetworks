**************************** TASK 2 ASSIGNMENT ********************************
Socket Programming: It helps us to connect a client to a server. Client is
                    message sender and receiver and server is just a listener
                    that works on data sent by client.

Thread: A thread is a light-weight process that does not require much memory
        overhead, they are cheaper than processes.

Multi-threading Socket Programming: Multithreading is a process of executing
                                    multiple threads simultaneously in a single
                                    process.

                        MULTI-THREADING MODULES
A _thread module & threading module is used for multi-threading in python,
these modules help in synchronization and provide a lock to a thread in use.

=>    from _thread import *
=>    import threading

A lock object is created by->

=>    print_lock = threading.Lock()

A lock has two states, “locked” or “unlocked”. It has two basic methods
acquire() and release(). When the state is unlocked print_lock.acquire()
is used to change state to locked and print_lock.release() is used to change
state to unlock.

The function thread.start_new_thread() is used to start a new thread and
return its identifier. The first argument is the function to call and its
second argument is a tuple containing the positional list of arguments.
